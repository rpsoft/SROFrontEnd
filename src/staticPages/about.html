<a name="stationersCompany"></a><p><h3>The Stationers&rsquo; Company and the London book trade</h3></p>
<p>The Stationers&rsquo; Company is one of London&rsquo;s several dozen &ldquo;livery companies,&rdquo; most of which date their origins to the late medieval or early modern period. One became a freeman of a company&mdash;and thus, a freeman or citizen of London&mdash;either through the completion of an apprenticeship, by having been born to a freeman (&ldquo;patrimony&rdquo;), or by payment of a fee (&ldquo;redemption&rdquo;). It is from the livery companies&rsquo; ranks that the Lord Mayor of London has been chosen almost every year since medieval times.</p>

<p>The Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers, to adopt the formula that has been used as a formal designation of the livery companies since at least the late sixteenth century, is currently ranked 47th out of the 107 companies. For most of its history, the Company has been in the second half of the civic pecking order. It is one of forty or so livery companies to maintain its own hall: it moved to its current location, just off Ludgate Hill and a stone&rsquo;s throw from the historical home of the book trade in England, St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, four hundred years ago, although the hall was rebuilt after the Great Fire and was substantially restored after bombing during World War II. The Company can trace an institutional history back to 1403 when the city authorities formally granted the two misteries of Textwriters (scribes of non-legal manuscripts) and Limners (illuminators of manuscripts), and those &ldquo;citizens of London, who use to bind and sell books&rdquo;, the right to establish a single book-trade association. The word &ldquo;Stationers&rdquo; appears first in the title of this Company in 1417, and from 1441 this became its sole name. In 1557 the Company, numbering at least 133 freemen, was <a href="http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cam/tools/request/showRecord.php?id=record_uk_1557"><u>incorporated</u></a> by Mary Tudor and her husband, Philip II of Spain, an act that was formally confirmed by Elizabeth I in 1559.</p>

<p>The Company was governed by a Master and two Wardens, chosen annually from a Court of Assistants who acted as the Company&rsquo;s executive. The Company&rsquo;s incorporated status endured until 1684, when all the London companies were issued with informations of <em>quo warranto</em> that in effect dissolved them as part of Charles II&rsquo;s audacious attempt to gerrymander the national electorate (the privileged rank of the companies, the livery, had the right to vote for London MPs). The Stationers&rsquo; Company was the first to seek a new <a href="http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cam/tools/request/showRecord.php?id=record_uk_1684"><u>incorporation</u></a>, which further extended its powers, but this lasted only a few years: in 1688 James II revoked all the informations of quo warranto, and in 1690 a statute formally restored the status quo ante bellum. The Company continued to operate formally under the terms of the 1557 incorporation until the 1930s, when it merged with the recently established Newspaper Makers&rsquo; Company; a fresh charter, in its new name, was issued in 1937.</p>

<p>Although the Company had jurisdiction over the book trade and (from 1557) printing, not every member of the Company was a member of the book trade; nor was every member of the book trade a member of the Company.</p>

<p><h3>The Stationers&rsquo; Register</h3></p>
<p>The Stationers&rsquo; Register was instrumental in the development of Anglo-American copyright. The Register was cited in Britain&rsquo;s first copyright statute, the <a href="http://www.copyrighthistory.org/cam/tools/request/showRecord.php?id=record_uk_1710"><u>Act for the Encouragement of Learning</u></a>, in 1710, and remained part of the copyright system through to the early twentieth century. The Register survives in an almost unbroken sequence from 1557 until 1842 at <a href="https://stationers.org/library-archives/archives.html"><u>Stationers&rsquo; Hall</u></a>, and then until 1924 at the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/copyright-records-stationers-hall/"><u>National Archives</u></a>.</p>

<p>From about 1510 onwards, English printers or booksellers who wanted to protect their rights to publish a particular book would secure a &lsquo;privilege&rsquo;, usually from the Crown. The process was bureaucratic and costly; there was no mechanism for ensuring that privileges didn&rsquo;t clash, and was no easy process for resolution: disputes would ultimately have to be settled by formal legal proceedings.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to establish a system of granting publishing rights operated by trusted members of the book trade; that had sufficient authority among the trade as a whole; that was reliable, easy, and relatively cheap to use; that provided a straightforward means for resolving disagreements; and that did not interfere with or challenge existing or future Crown privileges. A London company like the Stationers&rsquo; Company was ideally placed to develop such a system: it had an established authority, it maintained records, it had a system for arbitrating disputes, and it had a deep-seated ethos of mutual social obligation and equity that sought to balance an individual&rsquo;s commercial autonomy with the well-being of the trade as a whole. However, it was only following incorporation in 1557, which restricted printing to members of the Company or those who had received privileges from the Crown, that the Company could claim sufficient jurisdiction over the London book trade to make such a system possible.</p>

<p>In 1554, the Clerk of the Stationers&rsquo; Company began to write in a manuscript volume that is currently, but erroneously, known as &lsquo;Register A&rsquo; (TSC/1/D/02/01). The first nineteen pages record monies received by the Wardens between December 1554 and July 1557, which include fees for binding and freeing apprentices, fines for breaking ordinances, collections made for the Lord Mayor and other fundraising. Only one item relates to the publication of a specific work: John Walley was fined for printing &lsquo;a breafe Cronacle contrary to our ordenances before he Ded presente the Copye to the wardyns&rsquo; (f.7r). This note provides us with the first evidence of a system for managing publishing rights that the Company had established following its incorporation in May 1557.</p>

<p>None of the early volumes in which entrances were recorded was titled at the time as a &lsquo;Register&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Register A&rsquo; (in fact, a set of Wardens’ Accounts) is a later creation while the next three are known as Liber B, Liber C, and Liber D. The sixteenth-century Company talked of its &lsquo;Book of copies&rsquo; or the &lsquo;clerk&rsquo;s books&rsquo; or the &lsquo;hall book&rsquo; or the &lsquo;book of entrances for the clerk&rsquo; or the &lsquo;entry book of copies&rsquo;; the earliest references to a &lsquo;register&rsquo; date from 1599 (&lsquo;Registrum Copiarum&rsquo;) and 1605 (&lsquo;Register of Copies&rsquo;) but even then &lsquo;Hall book&rsquo; was still being used in the 1630s. It was not until 1620 that the Company&rsquo;s Clerk began to maintain a separate volume solely for recording entrances. The entries up to 1571 are not entrances per seas they are recorded only as part of the annual lists of payments received by the Wardens; it was only from 1576 that records of entrances themselves survive. (There are no surviving details regarding the entrances made between July 1571 and July 1576). Strictly speaking, therefore, the Stationers’ Register as a distinct set of records only begins in 1576, but the Register as a system for authorising publication rights dates back to 1557.</p>
    
In order not to clutter the browse and search interfaces, SRO refers to the Register volumes simply as part of an alphabetical sequence, rather than by their full historical names.</p>

<p>The basic procedure for the first 150 years of the Register&rsquo;s existence was as follows: an individual publisher had to seek the approval of the officers of the Company to publish a particular work; once a publisher was granted those rights (the <strong>&lsquo;copy&rsquo;</strong>), no other member of the Stationers&rsquo; Company was allowed to publish that work without the permission of the owner&mdash;if they did, the owner could seek redress through the Company. This Company-specific authorisation (which the Company called <strong>&lsquo;licence&rsquo;</strong>) was separate from the state system of pre-publication licensing (which, confusingly, the Company described as <strong>&lsquo;authority&rsquo;</strong>). The licensing system predated the creation of the Register and required every book to be licenced by a state-approved individual (usually a clergyman) before its publication. With the new record-keeping from 1576, entries in the Register began to record whether a licence had been granted and from whom; on occasion, the Company&rsquo;s officers indicate that their authorisation is conditional on a licence being granted. However, while the Register provides information about the licensing of books and the names of specific licensers, it was never formally part of the licensing system.</p>

<p>Seeking the approval of the Company&rsquo;s officers involved a fee; for a further fee, the details of the copy were formally written down by the Clerk in the Register. These were two distinct practices, and for at least sixty-five years there was no expectation that all books that were authorised by the Company&rsquo;s officers were entered in the Register. A decision made by the Company in 1622 [Court Book C, f.74r; William A. Jackson, William, ed., <em>Records of the Court of the Stationers&rsquo; Company 1602 to 1640</em> (London: Bibliographical Society, 1957), p.149] seems to indicate that <strong>&lsquo;entrance&rsquo;</strong> (as it was known) was expected although in practice little changed; it was not until 1637 that entrance was made compulsory. As a result, many copies that were authorised prior to 1637 were simply not recorded in the Register.</p>

<p>The lack of an entry does not mean that the copy was any less legitimate: however, an entrance made it easier to demonstrate that a copy had been authorised, which could be useful for any later disputes over copy ownership.</p>

<p>The wording of an entry and the details recorded vary over the first few decades but generally speaking an entry included the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The name of the copy owner (enterer) in the left-hand margin&mdash;this could be more than one individual or, in the case of the Company&rsquo;s joint-stock ventures in the seventeenth-century, a corporate body</p></li>
  <li><p>The description of the work&mdash;this could range from a general description to something that looks like a specific title; however, this should not be assumed to be an accurate transcription of a work&rsquo;s title as published</p></li>
  <li><p>A date&mdash;until the 1570s this was often just an indication of the relevant Company year</p></li>
  <li><p>The names of the state licenser and the Company officers who, respectively, provided the &lsquo;authority&rsquo; and &lsquo;license&rsquo; for the work&mdash;this information is absent for the first few decades</p></li>
  <li><p>A fee&mdash;prior to 1587 the fee varied (initially depending on the likely number of printed sheets in a work, later on whether it was a book or a ballad or small pamphlet); it was then standardised at sixpence per copy for the remainder of the early-modern period.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The vast majority of copies were entered by members of the Stationers&rsquo; Company but, until the early seventeenth century, it was possible for members of the London book trade who belonged to other London companies (such as the Drapers&rsquo; Company) to enter copies in their own name.</p>

<p>Entrances could be formally cancelled; these cancellations are often annotated. The Register was also used to record reassignments of copies from one individual to another, although many such reassignments must have taken place without any note made in the Register.</p>

<p>Scholars have known about the Stationers&rsquo; Register&mdash;and recognised its literary, historical, and legal value&mdash;from the eighteenth century onwards. William Herbert (1718&ndash;95) transcribed the first two volumes and part of the third, as part of his revisions to Joseph Ames&rsquo;s <em>Typographical Antiquities</em> (1785&ndash;90). These manuscript volumes are held at Stationers&rsquo; Hall. Excerpts were published in John Nichols, <em>Illustrations of Manners and Expences of Antient Times in England</em> (1797) and John Payne Collier, <em>Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company</em> (1848&ndash;9); Collier&rsquo;s manuscript survives at the Folger Shakespeare Library.</p>

<p>The first comprehensive edition&mdash;which transcribed all the entries relating to copies between 1557 and 1640&mdash;was Edward Arber&rsquo;s <em>Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers 1554&ndash;1640 AD </em>(1875&ndash;94). A continuation (known as &lsquo;Eyre and Rivington&rsquo; although the transcript was prepared by H. R. Plomer) was published between 1913 and 1914, transcribing all the entries of copies from 1640 to 1708. Microfilm later in the century gave access to the Registers of the eighteenth century and beyond.</p>

<p>Despite their importance, the copies in the Stationers&rsquo; Register have yet to be fully indexed. Arber indexed names and places in his transcript; a index of names in Eyre and Rivington was prepared by W. P. Williams in 1980. There are no other indexes for the pre-1708 period.</p>
