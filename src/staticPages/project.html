<h3>Project History</h3>

<p>The goal of Stationers&rsquo; Register Online is to create a searchable database of the copy-entries recorded in the Stationers&rsquo; Register. The project began in 2011 when Giles Bergel received a grant from the University of Oxford&rsquo;s JPR Lyell Fund to produce transcriptions of the two series of edited volumes of the Stationers&rsquo; Register - Arber, and Eyre and Rivington (see Bibliography), which span the Register period from 1557 until 1708. Copies of these pioneering works, long out of copyright, had been scanned and placed online by <a href="https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6177070">Columbia University Library</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/1913transcriptof01statuoft">University of Toronto</a>.</p>

<p>An editorial team consisting of Giles Bergel, (University of Oxford); Ian Gadd (Bath Spa University); James Cummings (Oxford, IT Services); and Pip Willcox (Oxford, Bodleian Libraries) commissioned Invida Solutions to create XML transcripts of both series. The XML encoding preserved these works&rsquo; typographical conventions (established by Arber and followed by Eyre and Rivington) that identified members of the Stationers&rsquo; Company or indicated the titles of works. Arber&rsquo;s notes on individual entries are displayed in the current version of Stationers&rsquo; Register Online. All other content not present in the original Registers was omitted from the XML transcripts.</p>

<h3>Editorial </h3>
<p>Stationers&rsquo; Register Online is a record of both the cancelled and uncancelled copy-entries made in the series of volumes now known as the Stationers&rsquo; Register. It is not a facsimile edition of either the Register or its prior transcripts such as Arber, but a newly-edited reference work based on both sources. Whilst both the original archival sources and Arber&rsquo;s transcript contain much else that is of interest to scholars of the Company (such as notes of fines, drafts of entrances made elsewhere, membership records and sundry Company accounts and memoranda) SRO contains only the volumes&rsquo; recording of permissions to publish a work, together with Arber&rsquo;s notes on individual entries. Future versions will include additional analysis; more structured Browse options, and links to bibliographical and biographical resources.</p>

<p>For the present version of SRO, each entry from the pilot project&rsquo;s Arber XML transcript was proofed and corrected against digital images of the original Register, provided by kind permission of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers. Although Arber&rsquo;s transcript was of a high standard and some of his conventions (such as his expansion of abbreviations) have been retained, SRO diverges from Arber in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fraudulent additions to the original Register made by John Payne Collier (1789-1883) to entries between 1579 and 1594, present in Arber, have been removed. For these forgeries, see Dickey and Freeman, A and J in the Bibliography.</li>
<li>Annotations made to certain entries by George Steevens (1736-1800) and George Chalmers (1742-1825) have been deleted (see Myers, <em>Stationers&rsquo; Company Archive</em>)</li>
<li>Cancelled Register text not given in Arber has been supplied. This often consists merely of scribal errors, but cancelled names and their substitutes sometimes reveal a pattern of entrance and almost immediate transfer of copies: the editors are grateful to Peter Blayney for alerting us to the meaning of this practice.</li>
<li>Marginalia not given in Arber has usually been supplied, apart from occasional running tallies of fees made by the Company Clerk that do not relate to individual entries.</li>
<li>Scribal graphs for capital-F (Unicode: U+FB00); th (00FE) and long-s (U+017F) which are inconsistently rendered in Arber have been transliterated to their closest modern equivalents. SRO otherwise reverts to the Register&rsquo;s original spelling and capitalisation.</li>
<li>Annotations in either the Register or Arber that apply to more than one entry have been applied as Notes on each individual entry.</li>
<li>Arber&rsquo;s markup of names of Stationers has been retained, and where necessary corrected or extended. It provides the ability to search or filter by Stationers and others.</li>
<li>Arber&rsquo;s markup of Titles has also been retained, but is not displayed in the entry.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Dates</em></p>
<p>It is not until the 1570s that the Stationers&rsquo; Company&rsquo;s Clerk systematically dated entries made in the Register. Some earlier entries were given specific dates, but the vast majority of entries made up to 1571 were grouped only by the Company&rsquo;s year.</p>

<p>It cannot be assumed that entries were always entered in date sequence, even once specific dates are supplied, as it is not clear exactly how or when the Clerk wrote up the entries. For all dated entries, SRO uses the Clerk&rsquo;s dates as written even where it seems entirely possible that these are wrong as there are occasions where entries do seem to have been genuinely entered out of chronological order. However, for earlier years where dates are rarely supplied we have provided date-spans that assume chronological sequence: i.e. an undated entry between two dated entries is presumed to have been entered between those two dates.</p>

<p><em>Names</em></p>
<p>All names, whether of individuals or fictional characters, are searchable and browsable under their original spellings within the Register. A future version of this resource will include name authorities for members of the book trade; licensers; and other persons commonly named within the Register. Members of the Stationers&rsquo; Company are attributed, and searches and browses can distinguish them from all other names. Names of persons entering copies are recorded and may be searched.</p>

<p>The Master and Wardens of the Company at the time of each entrance are given in the metadata for each entry.</p>

<p><em>Copy-Titles</em></p>
<p>The Register&rsquo;s recording of the title of the copy to be entered may closely follow the title of a work as published, but at times it is unclear what title the enterer had in mind. Arber attempted to delineate titles with italics:&nbsp; SRO retains this markup for the purposes of search (it is not displayed), but on occasion emends Arber&rsquo;s selection. SRO thus demarcates all of the entry text that appears to describe the title of the work, but users must keep in mind that the title of a work as published may differ markedly from the form of words given in the Register. If the title-text in the entry is fragmented, a search on a phrase divided between fragments may not retrieve the matching entry (searching on the full entry will, however). Future releases of SRO will attempt to link entrance to a work&rsquo;s publication history under the terms of that entrance.</p>

<p><em>Entry Types/Status</em></p>
<p>SRO groups entries under at least one of the following types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Entered - The default type.</li>
<li>Shared - An entry made by more than one individual.</li>
<li>Reassigned - An entry made over from one or more enterers to another.</li>
<li>Stock - An entry made on behalf of one of the official Company joint stocks, such as the English or Latin Stock.</li>
<li>Incomplete - An entry lacks an expected feature such as the name of an enterer, copy-title, or fee. No judgement is implied as to why this information was not recorded at the point of entrance.</li>
<li>Cancelled - The entry is entirely crossed out or otherwise cancelled in the Register.</li>
<li>Other.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Fees</em></p>
<p>Fees are summed and listed in the metadata. Until 1582, fees were calculated according to the number of sheets in the book (a third-of-a-penny per sheet, with a minimum of 4<em>d</em>); this became standardised as 6<em>d</em> for a book, and 4<em>d </em>for a pamphlet or ballad. With a few exceptions, 6<em>d</em> became the standard fee from 1587 onwards. Arber&rsquo;s comments on fees are often of interest, and show if a fee may have been miscalculated or does not appear to correspond to the standard rates.</p>

<p>Arber reference</p>
<p>The page(s) of Arber in which an entry appears.</p>

<p>Register reference</p>
<p>The folio(s) or page(s) of the original Register. The foliation of the Register is occasionally erroneous: this has been noted.</p>
