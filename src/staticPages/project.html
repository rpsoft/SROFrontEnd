<h3>Project History</h3>
<p>
    The goal of Stationers’ Register Online is to create a searchable database
    of the copy-entries recorded in the Stationers’ Register. The project began
    in 2011 when Giles Bergel received a grant from the University of Oxford’s
    JPR Lyell Fund to produce transcriptions of the two series of edited
    volumes of the Stationers’ Register - Arber, and Eyre and Rivington (see
    Bibliography), which span the Register period from 1557 until 1708. Copies
    of these pioneering works, long out of copyright, had been scanned and
    placed online by
    <a href="https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6177070">
        Columbia University Library
    </a>
    and the
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/1913transcriptof01statuoft">
        University of Toronto
    </a>
    .
</p>

<p>
    An editorial team consisting of Giles Bergel, (University of Oxford); Ian
    Gadd (Bath Spa University); James Cummings (Oxford, IT Services); and Pip
    Willcox (Oxford, Bodleian Libraries) commissioned Invida Solutions to
    create XML transcripts of both series. The XML encoding preserved these
    works’ typographical conventions (established by Arber and followed by Eyre
    and Rivington) that identified members of the Stationers’ Company or
    indicated the titles of works. Arber’s notes on individual entries are
    displayed in the current version of Stationers’ Register Online. All other
    content not present in the original Registers was omitted from the XML
    transcripts.
</p>

<h3>
    Editorial
</h3>

<p>
    Stationers’ Register Online is a record of the copy-entries made in the
    series of volumes now known as the Stationers’ Register, both cancelled and
    uncancelled. It is not a facsimile edition of either the Register or its
    prior transcripts such as Arber, but a newly-edited reference work derived
    from both. While the original archival sources and Arber’s transcript
    contain much else that is of interest to scholars of the Company (such as
    notes of fines, drafts of entrances made elsewhere, membership records and
    sundry Company accounts and memoranda) SRO contains only the volumes’
    recording of permissions to publish a work, together with Arber’s notes on
    individual entries. Future versions may include additional analysis;
    additional browse and search options, notes and cross-references; and links
    to other bibliographical and biographical resources.
</p>

<p>
    For the present version of SRO each entry from the pilot project’s Arber
    XML transcript was proofed and corrected against digital images of the
    original Register, provided by kind permission of the Worshipful Company of
    Stationers and Newspaper Makers. Although Arber’s transcript was of a high
    standard and some of his conventions (such as his expansion of
    abbreviations) have been retained, SRO diverges from Arber in the following
    ways:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The fraudulent additions to the original Register made by John
            Payne Collier (1789-1883) to entries between 1579 and 1594, present
            in Arber, have been removed. For these forgeries, see Dickey and
            Freeman, A and J in the Bibliography.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Annotations made to certain entries by George Steevens (1736-1800)
            and George Chalmers (1742-1825) have been deleted (see Myers,
            Stationers’ Company Archive)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Cancelled Register text not given in Arber has been supplied. This
            often consists merely of scribal errors, but cancelled names and
            their substitutes sometimes reveal a pattern of entrance and almost
            immediate transfer of copies: the editors are grateful to Peter
            Blayney for alerting us to the meaning of this practice.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Marginalia not given in Arber has usually been supplied, apart from
            occasional running tallies of fees made by the Company Clerk that
            do not relate to individual entries.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Scribal graphs for ﬀ; thorn (þ) and long s (ſ) have been 
            transliterated to their closest modern
            equivalents. SRO otherwise reverts to the Register’s original
            spelling and capitalisation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Annotations in either the Register or Arber that apply to more than
            one entry have been applied as Notes on each individual entry.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arber’s markup of names of Stationers has been retained, and where
            necessary corrected or extended. It provides the ability to search
            or filter by Stationers and others.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arber’s markup of Titles has also been retained, but is not
            displayed in the entry.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>
    Dates
</h3>
<p>
    It is not until the 1570s that the Stationers’ Company’s Clerk
    systematically dated entries made in the Register. Some earlier entries
    were given specific dates, but the vast majority of entries made up to 1571
    were grouped only by the Company’s year.
</p>
<p>
    The Registers take the start of the calendar year as 25 March but the dates
    given for all entries in SRO presume that the start of the calendar year is
    January. In other words, users do not need to 'correct' the cited year
    for entries in January, February, or March.

</p>

<p>
    It cannot be assumed that entries were always entered in date sequence,
    even once specific dates are supplied, as it is not clear exactly how or
    when the Clerk wrote up the entries. For all dated entries, SRO uses the
    Clerk’s dates as written even where it seems entirely possible that these
    are wrong as there are occasions where entries do seem to have been
    genuinely entered out of chronological order. However, for earlier years
    where dates are rarely supplied we have provided date-spans that assume
    chronological sequence: i.e. an undated entry between two dated entries is
    presumed to have been entered between those two dates.
</p>

<h3>
    Names
</h3>
<p>
    All names, whether of individuals or fictional characters, are searchable
    and browsable under their original spellings within the Register. Future
    versions of this resource may include standardised names for members of the
    book trade, authors, licensers and other individuals. Members of the
    Stationers’ Company and enterers of copies are identified within the XML.
</p>

<p>
    The Master and Wardens of the Company at the time of each entrance are
    given in the metadata for each entry.
</p>
<h3>
    Copy-Titles
</h3>
<p>
    The Register’s recording of the title of the copy to be entered may closely
    follow the title of a work as published, but at times it is unclear what
    title the enterer had in mind. Arber attempted to delineate titles with
    italics: SRO retains this markup for the purposes of search (it is not
    displayed), but on occasion emends Arber’s selection. SRO thus demarcates
    all of the entry text that appears to describe the title of the work, but
    users must keep in mind that the title of a work as published may differ
    markedly from the form of words given in the Register. If the title-text in
    the entry is fragmented, a search on a phrase divided between fragments may
    not retrieve the matching entry (searching on the full entry will,
    however). Future releases of SRO will attempt to link entrance to a work’s
    publication history under the terms of that entrance.
</p>

<h3>
    Entry Types/Status
</h3>
<p>
    SRO groups entries under at least one of the following types.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Entered. The default type.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Shared. An entry made by more than one individual.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Reassigned. An entry made over from one or more enterers to
            another.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Stock. An entry made on behalf of one of the official Company joint
            stocks, such as the English or Latin Stock.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Incomplete. An entry lacks an expected feature such as the name of
            an enterer, copy-title, or fee. No judgement is implied as to why
            this information was not recorded at the point of entrance.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Cancelled. The entry is entirely crossed out or otherwise cancelled
            in the Register.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Other.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Fees
</h3>
<p>
    Fees are summed and listed in the metadata. Until 1582, fees were
    calculated according to the number of sheets in the book (a
    third-of-a-penny per sheet, with a minimum of 4d; this became standardised
    as 6d for a book, and 4d for a pamphlet or ballad. With a few exceptions,
    6d became the standard fee from 1587 onwards. Arber’s comments on fees are
    often of interest, and show if a fee may have been miscalculated or does
    not appear to correspond to the standard rates.
</p>

<p>
    Arber reference
</p>
<p>
    The page(s) of Arber in which an entry appears.
</p>

<p>
    Register reference
</p>
<p>
    The folio(s) or page(s) of the original Register. The foliation of the
    Register is occasionally erroneous: this has been noted.
